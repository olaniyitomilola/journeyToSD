I have been making attempts to become a software developer since 2018. Tried HNG, got bored and got disqualified. Picked the basics of html and css at this point and I left all things sofware, for months, until 2020. In 2020, I decided to give android development some tried. Android applications development using Android studio and java. Enrolled for Google Developers Program, built basic android apps and...... gave up again.

I have been pretty comfortable. The last time I 'worked' was in 2017 when I was working as a Town Planning Intern at Structura casa, NYSC, in 2018, was a waste of time, so I wont really call that work. Ever since this period, I have been more like a risk taker than a worker. I sit at home and let the little money I have gathered do their wonders. Cryptocurrency and a sort of dropshipping. Good returns and headache. During the headache days, I remember software development. Something I can fall back to when the Risk taker life gets tough. It has always been my escape plan, but most times, I have nothing to escape from. So my basic html and css was more like hobby to me.

I love software engineering, the headache days aside, it is something I really want to be doing. So I thought of what to do. The answer I got was to academically transition into tech. Masters in Computer Science might not be easy for someone with and surveying and geoinformatics/Urban and Regional Planning background, so I opted for a conversion course in Anglia Ruskin University, Information and Communication Technology. Sounds fair, I am finally tranisitioning into tech. I had no patience for scholarship, I just wanted to get started. Fourteen Thousand Pounds in School fees and an estimated nine thousand, five hundred pounds in upkeep and house rent. All sounded like something I could afford. Deep dive.
